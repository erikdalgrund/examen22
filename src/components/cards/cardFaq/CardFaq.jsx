        <h2>Interior Paint FAQs</h2>
        <span className='card-faq--items'>
        <p>
            Taking on the task of house painting comes with many decisions. 
            Choosing paint colors, paint sheens, and hiring professional painters 
            are just some of the decisions you’ll make when you’re ready to transform 
            your home with new interior paint. While you can certainly find interior 
            design ideas in magazines, on the internet, and in other people’s homes, 
            the dos and don’ts are a little harder to come by.

            Here are a few Interior Painting FAQs that we at New Life Painting are ready to answer to help get you started.

            <h2>How do I select an interior paint color?</h2>
            <p>
              The answer to this questions could go on for pages, but we will try to keep it simple.
              The first thing to consider is lighting. A poorly lit room will appear brighter, bigger,
              and more open when painted a light paint color.
              Larger rooms can be made to feel a little more cozy when painted a darker paint color.
              Small rooms will have a more dramatic feel when painted darker colors.
              Paint colors really have a lot to do with the mood you want to evoke in a room as well as your personal style.

            <h2>Should I try out paint colors?</h2>
            <p>
              Even if you feel determined that you have chosen the right color, it is worth your
              time and money to buy a sample and test it out in your room. Paint colors can look
              drastically different in your home than they will in the paint store or online. Rather
              than painting small patches all over your room, paint poster board with your
              chosen colors and tape it to your wall. You can move the poster board around the
              room in order to see how your color acts in different lighting situations.

            <h2>How do I choose the best paint sheen for my paint job?</h2>
            <p>
              Choosing a sheen is actually easier than choosing your paint color. Most interior
              rooms are going to be painted with a satin or eggshell finish. Eggshell is the safe
              middle ground between high gloss and matte. It creates a smooth finish that is
              also easy to clean. Smaller areas like doors, trim, and cabinets, can be painted in a
              high gloss or semi-gloss sheen. These areas are less likely to get dirty and look best
              with some gloss. Matte sheen is most often used for something like your ceiling.
              While painting with a matte sheen is easy, it’s not easy to clean, 
              so it’s better to use on areas with less traffic.

            <h2>How do I prep a room for interior painting?</h2>
            <p>
              Your first step to prep a room for painting is to remove all of the furniture. If the room is large enough, 
              furniture can be placed in the center of the room. Next, take
              everything off of the walls. If there are holes in the walls from art or pictures 
              that have been hanging, fill in the holes before painting.
